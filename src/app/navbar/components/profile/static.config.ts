      "I graduated from the University of Birmingham in July 2018 with a first class degree in Liberal Arts & Sciences. I majored in Theology, focusing on the intersection of Islam, politics and the media. My dissertation explored the relationship between Trump's rise to power and Islamophobia in the media. Additionally, I minored in Maths where I was particularly interested in Linear Programming and Optimization. I took an entrepreneurial module in my final year where Birmingham City Council asked us to come up with a business idea to tackle the social issue of safety for residents in Birmingham. As a team of four, we produced a business plan and pitched our idea of a smart alarm system to a panel which included professionals from IBM, E-Spark and Midven.",
